this code implements a deep learning model for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)
communication systems, which is a technique used in wireless communications to serve multiple users simultaneously on the same frequency band. Here's how it applies to the NOMA context and how each part contributes to the model:

### Understanding the NOMA-Specific Aspects of the Code

1. **Multiple Users in the Same Channel**:
   - In a NOMA setup, multiple users share the same channel, but they are separated by their power levels or specific signal processing techniques. Here, two users (User 1 and User 2) are represented by `k1` and `k2`.
   - The parameters `M1` and `M2` define the number of symbols available for each user, creating distinct constellation points for them, which are then mapped to their respective signal spaces.

2. **Encoder for Shared Representation**:
   - The model uses an encoder to map both users' data into a shared latent space (`encoded2`). In NOMA, this shared space with power constraints ensures that the encoded signals for multiple users occupy a common resource efficiently.
   - The encoder’s output is then processed with an average power constraint (`encoded2 = Lambda(lambda x: x / K.sqrt(K.mean(x**2)))(encoded1)`), which adjusts the power of the encoded signals, simulating the power-domain separation typically employed in NOMA.

3. **Channel with Different SNRs**:
   - The code simulates different SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) levels for each user (`SNR1` and `SNR2`), which is critical in NOMA systems since power allocation varies by user. High-power users typically have higher SNR.
   - Gaussian noise is added in two channels (`channel1` and `channel2`) to emulate realistic channel conditions with specific SNRs. This simulates how User 1 and User 2 experience different noise levels, reflecting power-domain multiplexing.

4. **Decoders for Each User**:
   - The model includes two separate decoders for each user. This aligns with NOMA’s requirement to decode users’ signals independently, depending on their SNR levels.
   - **User 1 Decoder**: Processes the high-SNR signal (from `channel1`) to retrieve User 1’s data. The high SNR allows for more accurate decoding.
   - **User 2 Decoder**: Processes the lower-SNR signal (from `channel2`). This decoder architecture adjusts to handle signals with more noise and interference.

5. **Constellation Diagram and Symbol Mapping**:
   - The `plot_constellation` and `plot_constellation_3d` functions visualize how constellation points are distributed for each user. This is key in NOMA, as constellation diagrams help assess how well users' signals are separated in a shared resource space.

6. **Bit Error Rate (BER) Calculation**:
   - BER is calculated over a range of SNR values to evaluate the model’s performance in terms of decoding accuracy. This step helps measure the model’s ability to accurately separate and decode the signals for each user despite the interference and noise.
   - NOMA systems require BER evaluation to understand how effectively the system serves multiple users simultaneously with minimal errors.

### Summary of the Model's Purpose for NOMA

This deep learning model is an **autoencoder-based NOMA system** that leverages power-domain multiple access to serve two users in the same channel. It trains the neural network to encode and decode data under different SNR conditions, allowing for effective simultaneous transmission for multiple users. 

In essence, the model learns to:
- Efficiently encode user data while adhering to power constraints.
- Simulate realistic channel noise conditions for each user.
- Decode each user's data independently, despite shared resources and noise, achieving low BER across various SNR levels. 

This setup is particularly useful for NOMA, where the objective is to maximize channel efficiency and ensure reliable communication for multiple users on the same frequency band.
